## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I'm still not exactly used to laying out web pages with grid so
I would like to get better at doing so, as well as creating responsive, and accessible mobile navigation menus.
